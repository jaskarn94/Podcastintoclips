# Podcastintoclips

We all know that our attention span is less today as compared to last decade. We can rarely complete a full podcast in one go. 

My intention was to write a program which divides a 90 minute podcast into an average of 10 miniclips with each miniclip being 8-10 minutes long.
This program will divide a mp3 file into clips based on the information provided in the description.

Result of this experiment is that I am able to sync my listening hobbies with my shallow activities like brushing, exercising, cooking, walking etc. I can 
absorb more content while investing very less amount of willpower to do things. 



Next targets for this coding program:

1. The program downloads the podcasts on its own.
Target date to do : 30 December 2020.

2. Now the miniclips are divided on the basis of timestamps provided by the host. I have to do some basic text formatting to get it ready for my program. 
I want that to be automated. 
Target Date: 30 December 2020

#The deadline for this project has to be pushed to 30 Jan 2021. 
As a matter of not able to live upto this deadline, i should write around 200 words on how to work on long term projects in a smart way so that i could do the deep work on them effortlessely.
