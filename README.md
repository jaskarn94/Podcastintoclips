# Podcastintoclips

We all know that our attention span is less today as compared to last decade. We can rarely complete a full podcast in one go. 

My intention was to write a program which divides a 90 minute podcast into an average of 10 miniclips with each miniclip being 8-10 minutes long.
This program will divide a mp3 file into clips based on the information provided in the description.

Result of this experiment is that I am able to sync my listening hobbies with my shallow activities like brushing, exercising, cooking, walking etc. I can 
absorb more content while investing very less amount of willpower to do things. 

All the mp3 files are automatically upload to the google drive. I can download the files from google drive to my phone.


Next Target: To Run this program on cloud. 
Date: 31 August 2021.
